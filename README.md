## About the Project

The **Reverse-Shell** project is a lightweight tool for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to study and test network vulnerabilities. It demonstrates the concept of reverse shells, emphasizing the importance of securing systems against such attacks.

### Why Use Reverse-Shell?
- To identify potential security gaps.
- For training and educational purposes in ethical hacking.
- To learn about secure communication protocols.

---

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Encrypted Communication**: Secure the connection using encryption protocols like AES.
- **Small Payload Size**: Designed to be unobtrusive and efficient.
- **Customizable**: Modify the script to adapt to specific penetration testing needs.
- **Interactive Shell**: Full command execution and file handling capabilities.
- **Logging**: Tracks activities for audit trails.
- **Network Resilience**: Handles disconnections gracefully and attempts reconnections.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8+ installed.
- Basic knowledge of networking and ethical hacking principles.
- Administrator/root permissions (for certain functionalities).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Macgyver02/Reverse-Shell.git
   cd Reverse-Shell
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure the configuration file (`config.py`) is set up correctly for your environment.

---

## Usage

### Running the Server

1. Start the listener on your attacking machine:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. Wait for incoming connections.

### Deploying the Client

1. Copy `client.py` to the target machine.
2. Execute the client to establish a connection:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

### Commands Overview

Once connected, you can:
- **Execute commands**: Run any system command.
- **Download files**: Transfer files from the target to your machine.
- **Upload files**: Send files to the target machine.
- **Terminate the connection**: Safely close the session.

---

## Configuration

Customize the following settings in `config.py`:
- **Server IP**: Set the IP address of your attacker's machine.
- **Port**: Define the port for the listener.
- **Encryption Key**: Specify the key for secure communication.
